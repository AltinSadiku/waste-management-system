# ✅ Notification System - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong?
The backend was trying to serialize the Notification entity with its lazy-loaded User relationship, causing a Hibernate serialization error.

## What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Created `NotificationResponse` DTO
2. ✅ Updated `NotificationController` to return DTOs instead of entities
3. ✅ This prevents Hibernate lazy-loading issues

## Files Changed:
- `src/main/java/com/kosovo/wastemanagement/dto/NotificationResponse.java` (NEW)
- `src/main/java/com/kosovo/wastemanagement/controller/NotificationController.java` (UPDATED)

## Next Steps:

### 1. Restart Backend
Stop your Spring Boot application (Ctrl+C) and restart it:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

OR if using your IDE, restart the application.

### 2. Clear Browser Token (Important!)
Open browser console (F12) and paste:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('token');
window.location.href = '/login';
```

### 3. Login Fresh
- Login with your credentials
- Get a new JWT token

### 4. Test Notification Bell
- Click the bell icon
- Should work without any errors!
- Should show notifications from backend

## Expected Result:
✅ Bell icon appears in navbar
✅ Badge shows unread count
✅ Clicking opens dropdown
✅ Notifications load properly
✅ No Hibernate serialization errors
✅ No 401 errors (if token is valid)

## If Still Getting 401:
Make sure your user account is active:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET is_active = 1, email_verified = 1 
WHERE username = 'YourUsername';
```

Then logout and login again to get fresh token.
