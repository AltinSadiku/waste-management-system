# Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The notification system for trash collection schedules has been fully implemented with both backend and frontend components.

## Backend Implementation ✅

### 1. CollectionScheduleService.java
- **Cron Job**: Runs every 30 seconds (for testing) - configured at line 77
- **Production Setting**: Change to `@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 18 * * *")` for daily 6 PM execution
- **Area-Based Filtering**: Only sends notifications to citizens within 5km of the collection area
- **Notification Types**: 
  - Email notifications via EmailService
  - In-app notifications via NotificationService

### 2. NotificationController.java
All endpoints are secured with JWT authentication:
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get all user notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread` - Get unread notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get count of unread notifications
- `PUT /api/notifications/{id}/read` - Mark specific notification as read
- `PUT /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all notifications as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/{id}` - Delete a notification

### 3. UserRepository.java
- New method: `findActiveVerifiedCitizensByArea(areaId)`
- Uses Haversine formula to calculate geographic distance
- Filters citizens within 5km radius of area center

## Frontend Implementation ✅

### 1. NotificationBell Component
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/NotificationBell.js`

**Features**:
- 🔔 Bell icon with unread count badge
- 📱 Responsive dropdown with notifications list
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Mark as read functionality
- ✅ Mark all as read functionality
- 🗑️ Delete individual notifications
- 🎨 Beautiful UI with dark mode support
- ⏰ Time ago formatting (e.g., "5m ago", "2h ago")
- 🎯 Different icons for different notification types:
  - 🚛 Truck icon for collection reminders
  - ⚠️ Alert icon for report status changes
  - 💬 Comment icon for report comments

### 2. Layout Component Integration
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/Layout.js`

**Integration Points**:
- Desktop navigation bar (right side, next to theme toggle)
- Mobile menu (in user profile section)

### 3. API Integration
**Location**: `frontend/src/services/api.js`

All notification API endpoints are properly configured:
```javascript
notificationsAPI.getNotifications()
notificationsAPI.getUnreadNotifications()
notificationsAPI.getUnreadCount()
notificationsAPI.markAsRead(id)
notificationsAPI.markAllAsRead()
notificationsAPI.deleteNotification(id)
```

## User Experience Flow

### For Citizens:
1. **Registration & Verification**
   - User registers with location (latitude/longitude)
   - Email verification required

2. **Automatic Notifications**
   - System checks collection schedules every 30 seconds (testing mode)
   - For each upcoming collection (tomorrow):
     - Filters citizens within 5km of collection area
     - Sends email notification
     - Creates in-app notification

3. **Viewing Notifications**
   - Bell icon shows unread count
   - Click to open dropdown with all notifications
   - See collection details: waste type, time, area, day
   - Mark as read or delete individual notifications
   - Mark all as read with one click

### Notification Content Example:
```
Title: "Collection Reminder"
Message: "Tomorrow's GENERAL WASTE collection at 08:00 in Downtown Area"
Type: COLLECTION_REMINDER
Icon: 🚛 Truck
```

## Testing the System

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd waste-management-system
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Test Collection Reminders
1. Create an area with center coordinates
2. Create a collection schedule for tomorrow's day of week
3. Register a user with coordinates near the area (within 5km)
4. Verify the user's email
5. Wait 30 seconds (or check logs for cron job execution)
6. Check the bell icon for new notifications

### 4. Monitor Logs
Watch for these log messages:
```
Starting collection reminder job...
Found X schedules for tomorrow (DAY_NAME)
Found Y citizens in area 'Area Name' for collection reminders
Sent collection reminder email to: user@example.com
```

## Production Configuration

### Change Cron Schedule:
In `CollectionScheduleService.java` line 77, change:
```java
@Scheduled(cron = "*/30 * * * * *") // Every 30 seconds (testing)
```
To:
```java
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 18 * * *") // Daily at 6 PM (production)
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
