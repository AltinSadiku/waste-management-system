- **MySQL 8.0** database with Liquibase migrations
- **JWT** authentication
- **Maven** for dependency management

## üìã Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MySQL 8.0+ or Docker
- Maven 3.6+

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Start MySQL and phpMyAdmin
docker-compose up -d

# MySQL will be available at localhost:3306
# phpMyAdmin will be available at http://localhost:8081
```

#### Option B: Manual MySQL Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE waste_management_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'waste_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'waste_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON waste_management_db.* TO 'waste_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd waste-management-system

# Update database configuration in src/main/resources/application.yml if needed
# Default credentials (if using Docker):
# spring.datasource.username=waste_user
# spring.datasource.password=waste_password

# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

**Note:** Liquibase will automatically create all database tables and insert sample data when the application starts for the first time.

## üìä Database Migrations with Liquibase

The project uses Liquibase for database version control and migrations:

### Migration Files
- `src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml` - Master changelog
- `src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-1.0.xml` - Initial schema creation
- `src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-1.1.xml` - Sample areas and schedules
- `src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-1.2.xml` - Sample users and reports

### Adding New Migrations
1. Create a new changelog file (e.g., `db.changelog-1.3.xml`)
2. Add your changes using Liquibase XML syntax
3. Include the new file in the master changelog
4. Restart the application to apply migrations

### Liquibase Commands
```bash
# Check migration status
./mvnw liquibase:status

# Generate migration SQL (without applying)
./mvnw liquibase:updateSQL

# Rollback last migration
./mvnw liquibase:rollback -Dliquibase.rollbackCount=1
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DB_USERNAME=waste_user
DB_PASSWORD=waste_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

### Application Configuration

Key configuration options in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/waste_management_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    username: ${DB_USERNAME:waste_user}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD:waste_password}

app:
  jwt:
    secret: ${JWT_SECRET:mySecretKey}
    expiration: 86400000 # 24 hours
```

## üì± Mobile Support

The system is designed to be mobile-responsive and can be easily converted to a React Native app for native mobile deployment.
